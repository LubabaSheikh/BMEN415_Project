# BMEN415_Project
### This project explores multiple machine learning models corresponding to a regression dataset, classification dataset and image input classification dataset. 

### The regression dataset regards the use of volumetric features of the brain to predict the age of a healthy patient. 
### <u>Regression Models:</u>
- Neural Net
- KNN 
- Linear Discriminant Analysis
- Stochastic Gradient Descent
- Regression Tree
- Multiple Linear Regression model
- Random Forests
- Decision Tree
- Ordinary Least Squares model
- Lasso model
- Bayesian Ridge Regression model
- Partial Least Squares model

### The classification dataset takes into account input features such as pregnancies, glucose, blood pressure, skin thickness, insulin, BMI, diabetes pedigree function and age in order to separate patients with diabetes from those without. 
### <u>Classification Models:</u>
- CART model
- Neural Nets
- Linear Discriminant Analysis
- Logistic Regression Classification
- Naive Bayes
- KNN
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest model
- Voting Classifier

### The image input classification dataset uses thousands of chest x-ray images of patients with pneumonia and patients without, to train a model classifying patients as having pneumonia or not.
### <u>Image Classification Model:</u>
- Convolutional Neural Network
